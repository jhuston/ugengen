##UGenGen
A simple template of boilerplate code to simplify writing lots of Supercollider UGens.

This could expand into a UGen generator for quickly stubbing out the code needed for different types of UGens.

The code structure is taken from a combination of the Supercollider help file for writing UGens, and Dan Stowell's chapter
in the Supercollider book.

Currently, The code is using the API for Supercollider 3.6.5.
